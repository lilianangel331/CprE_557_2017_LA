# Lilian Angel - CPRE 557 Final Project
## Overview
This application demonstrates a multi-texture(diffuse, specular, transparency, and normal maps) material rendered on a three-tiered hierarchial model using muliple colored lights. Specifically, you should see a blue-winged butterfly within a mapped environment.

## Interactions  
To navigate the scene, the mouse cursor affects the camera rotation while the keyboard arrows keys translate the camera forward, backward, left and right relative to the camera's orientation.
